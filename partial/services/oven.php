                                Usually, a problem with the keypad or the membrane switch can prevent you from selecting a program. In some machines, a
                                separate membrane switch is used. In these machines, you may have to only replace the membrane if the keypads don’t work properly.
                                The membrane switch is usually attached to the control board using the ribbon connector. To check the condition of the board and the
                                membrane switch you will need a multi-meter.</p>
