                            <p class="text-justify">If the microwave stops working, there could be a problem in the fuse or the door switch.
                                The fuse is a safety device that protects the microwave from strong current. It stops the flow of current to the microwave
                                when the current is too strong. If there is a problem with the fuse, the appliance will not work until the fuse is replaced.
                                When there is a problem with the door switch, you must get it replaced. To replace the switch, you will need professional help.</p>

                            <p>If you notice sparks inside the microwave, it could be due to problems in the internal cavity, diode, or the stirrer.
                                When food gets accumulated in the internal cavity of the microwave, it can cause sparks.
                                To rectify this problem, you must clean your microwave thoroughly. When there is a problem with the stirrer,
                                the energy of the microwave will concentrate on one area. Problem in the stirrer may be due to broken fan motor or
                                damaged stirrer belt. Replacing the stirrer belt or fan motor is a complex procedure that requires technical skills.
                                It is in your interest to contact a professional microwave oven repair company to identify and rectify the problem in the
                                stirrer.</p>

                                To rectify this problem, you must remove the debris caught in it and realign the tray.
                                If this does not solve the problem, you can check for problems in the drive bush. You may have to replace the
                                drive bush if it is damaged or broken. At times, the problem in the tray motor can cause this problem.
                                To check the condition of the motor, it is best to get technical help. The microwave open can give a serious
                                shock even when you unplug it. For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must get professional
                                help to repair the motor.</p>

                                If the microwave wonâ€™t heat, but you hear a loud buzzing sound, it means there could be a problem in the powder
                                diode, capacitor, or the magnetron. A diode is a component that is used to pass current in one direction.
                                If there is a problem in the diode, your appliance will not heat and you will hear a buzzing sound.
                                Test the diode and replace it if necessary. At times, a defective capacitor or magnetron may cause this problem.
                                You must check the capacitor and magnetron to find out if it is the cause of the problem. Make sure you discharge
                                the capacitor before checking its condition. If there is a problem in any of these parts, you must replace them immediately.

                                If you slam the door of the microwave too hard, it could damage the fuse.
                                Your appliance will not work until the fuse is replaced. A microwave is an extremely useful home
